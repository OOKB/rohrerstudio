Sorry I haven't gotten back to you sooner.

The lowest floor I can build a site for that I'd be proud of, you'd be glad to show people, and that would allow for good dynamic features, broad coverage of devices, and semi-easy updating is $2000. For that price my colleague and I can put something like the following together:

http://graduate.mica.edu/gradshow/2014/  
http://candhrestoration.com/

Both of these are using a sort of "1 page" formula where clicking a link scrolls you up and down the page to get you to the information you want — we could just as easily do multiple pages.

The main thing you'd probably be updating are the projects. We've come up with some ideas for updating those where folders of images for each project are shared on dropbox, or on flickr, or other similar file/image hosting or transfer services and then our server is able to grab them, process them, and make them available at different sizes when and where necessary.

Text content for the projects we've been handling as separate documents which are easy to edit, update and add via an online code tool 

In looking at a lot of other architecture sites, the main focus is always on images. I think we could treat the homepage as the project page — which would remove needing to figure out what to put on the homepage or needing some sort of landing gimmick, but keep the focus on images.

Based on that, here is what I am thinking.

Each project would get a "slice" on the homepage, the default sort would be newest on top, oldest on the bottom. This list of "slices" would then be sortable with some tools at the top of the page (like the MFA Thesis show example I sent http://graduate.mica.edu/gradshow/2014/ — or the "what we do" section here: http://www.rwdfoundation.org/whatwedo/ — or, like how the collection of textiles filters on this site: http://www.rogersandgoffigon.com/#collection/textile/48/p1 [click on "filters" and then select some things… the list dynamically removes/reorders things based on selections])

This would allow sorting/narrowing down of the "slices" by the categories you currently are using, or by date, or name, or location… whatever pieces of data you would want each project to have accessible to the filters.

Each slice would be clickable, and would link to a more broad project page with more detailed info and a slideshow of images when many images for a project exist. (maybe like this? http://rohrerdemo.ookb.co/project.html)

An alternate layout which still presents all the projects first could be something like this: http://rohrerdemo.ookb.co/alt.html

The other pages/sections can be their own simple pages, or just sections of the home page or a second long scrolling page… I hadn't given those much thought yet as they require the least amount of the total effort to build.

The $2000 would include my seeding the site with the projects you want to start with, provided you can get me the images (it doesn't seem like the current site has very large images), migrating most of the old content from the existing site, and helping whomever will be upkeeping the site moving forward get a handle on the few things required for adding/editing content (mostly the projects, awards, and publications I'm guessing?).

This would be built using a portfolio tool that a colleague and I are developing, so as we make improvements to the system your site will hopefully benefit as well… 

It is easiest for us to make the site work quickly and smoothly, as well as to fix issues when/if they occur if we host the site on our infrastructure (a global server network of the type used by Facebook, google, amazon, twitter, etc.). The cost of hosting is $25.00/mo or would be $250.00/yr if you pay for the whole year up front.
