Specifications.

1. Projects are the main "content" of the site.
  - Projects are the basis of the projects page, and also feed the "updates" through having awards and articles connected to them.
  - we've explored some options regarding how to get the projects onto the site. Initially we talked about using your Box acct. to sync images and project data from. However, in also thinking about the other things you want to be able to do — custom sort/filter the order of projects, pick 5 or 6 items for the homepage slideshow, potentially rearrange the order of images on the projects themselves, and provide custom homepage slideshow images for specific projects, it might be easier to have a web interface that does all of these things. With a web interface we can make sure that all content is entered in controlled, validatable ways, and we can then also provide some interfaces for selecting which items go to the homepage, etc.

2. Homepage.
  - custom list of chosen projects.
  - show up in simple slideshow
  - each image links to its project
  - do we need special "homepage slideshow" images so that the cropping, sizing, etc. is all carefull matched?

  - partner bios
    * at a future date may add additional bios for other staff.

4. Contact

  - map (google map?)
